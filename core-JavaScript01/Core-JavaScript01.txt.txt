Assignment- 1      JavaScript

Q.1- Write a program that  grades students  based on their marks.
Ans:     var marks = 40;

       if (marks > 90) {
             console.log("Student will get A grade");
         } else if (marks > 70 && marks <= 90) {
              console.log("Student will get B grade");
        } else if (marks > 50 && marks <= 70) {
             console.log("Student will get C grade");
        } else {
            console.log("Student will get F grade");
    }

Q.2- Generate numbers between any 2 ,given  numbers .
Ans : 
      const num1 = 10;
     const num2 = 25;

    for (let i = num1; i <= num2; i++) {
       console.log(i);
     }

Q.3-  Use a nested ternary operator to check that a number is positive, negative or zero. You have to print “positive” if the number is positive and similarly for negative and zero also.
Ans: 
       const number =1000;
      Const result=
      Number >0 ? “ positive ” : number <0 ? “ negative ” : “ zero”;
      console.log(result);

Q.4- Describe the use  of the comma operator in JavaScript and provide an example.
Ans - Comma operator (,) : It allows to combine multiple expressions into a single expression . It evaluates each of its operands from left to right and returns the value of the rightmost operand.
Ex 1. 
var x = (5, 10);

console.log(x); // Outputs 10

Ex 2.
for (var i = 0, j = 10; i < 5; i++, j--) {
    console.log(i + " " + j);
}

Q5. You're creating a basic login system. Make a login function with two things : a username and a password. Check if the username is "admin" and the password is "12375". If they're both correct, show "Login successful"; if not, show "Invalid  credentials."
Ans :     function login(username,password)
             {        const correctUsername=”admin”;
                      Const correctPassword=”12345”;
                  if(username==correctUsername && password=correctPassword)
                  {    
                          console.log(“Login successful”);
                  }else
                  {
                        console.log(“ Invalid credentials”);
                  }
             }
         login(“admin” ,”12345”);// correct credentials
        login(“user”,”@pass123”);// Incorrect credentials


Q.6- You are working on an e-commerce platform. Write a JavaScript program that takes the payment
method ("credit", "debit", or "paypal") as input and uses  a switch statement to determine and print the processing fee associated with each payment method. For example, "credit" may have a processing fee of 2%, "debit" 1.5%, and "paypal" 3%.

Ans -  let x = "credit";
           let y = "debit";
           let z = "paypal";

switch (x) {
    case "credit":
        console.log("2%");
        break;
    case "debit":
        console.log("5%");
        break;
    case "paypal":
        console.log("3%");
        break;
    default:
        console.log("Unknown payment method");
}


Q.7- You are building a weather application. Write a JavaScript program that takes the current temperature as input and uses the conditional (ternary) operator to determine and print the weather condition. If the temperature is above 30°C, the condition is "Hot"; otherwise, it is "Moderate".

Ans - var temperature=40;
        
    temperature>30 ? console.log(“Hot ”): console.log(“Moderate”);



Q.8- You are creating a program to calculate the sum of numbers. Write a JavaScript program that takes a positive integer as input and uses a do-while loop to calculate and print the sum of all numbers from 1 to the given integer.

Ans–   function calculateSum(n)
           {
              if(n<=0 || !Number.isInteger(n))
             { 
                    console.log(“enter positive number ”);
                    return;
            }
                 let sum=0;
                 let i=1;
          do{
                      sum+=i;
                      i++;     
                  } while(i<=n);
                 
console.log(“sum of number from 1 to n is ”) ;
}
calculateSum(5);
